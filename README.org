* KSP Reviva

KSP Reviva is the IVA Revival!

** For Players

If you like flying in first-person from the in-vehicle crewed cockpit, either in stock or
using [[https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/190737-18x-112x-rasterpropmonitor-adopted/][RPM]] and/or [[https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/160856-wip-111x-moardvs-avionics-systems-mas-interactive-iva-v123-21-may-2021/][MAS,]] then this mod is for you.

Features:

- Allow switching of IVA from stock to different alternates (if needed mods are loaded) using
  [[https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/140541-1112-b9partswitch-v2180-march-17/][B9PartSwitch]].
  
  - This can be done from the editor, and the settings are saved with the ship design.
  - This can *also* be done live from flight! Use the PAW right-click menu on the
    command module when not in IVA (yup, not realistic, but this is KSP). This allows for the
    player to load this mod on existing saves and change IVAs on already flying craft, or
    to try out different IVA.
  - Without Reviva, only the "last" IVA mod for each command module would be available.

- Links together stock and modded IVA into one place and provides limited patches to
  ensure they work in 1.12.x.
  
  - Note that this mod doesn't include the IVAs, but provides links for recommended or
    optional IVA mods, plus patches to allow them to run and be switched dynamically.
  
** For Modders

You can provide multiple IVAs for your crewed command modules: this might allow for an empty (low
resource) IVA and a more complex (heavy resource) IVA as an option, or tech level upgrades
from lower tech to higher tech (using B9PartSwitch part upgrades).

The only requirement is that there are seperately named INTERNAL definitions for each
selection. Module Manager is your friend, see the provided examples in Reviva and follow
the pattern. It is preferable that additional SUBTYPE are added to the standard IVASwitch
Module, so the user sees a consistent UI interface.

** Required Mods

For Reviva to be enabled there's a mimimum set of required mods (and their dependencies):

- Reviva - obviously, but this provides a small DLL that remembers the IVA selection and
  handles switching the IVA dynamically in the editor or in flight.
- [[https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/140541-1112-b9partswitch-v2180-march-17/][B9PartSwitch]] - this provides the main mechanism to define and switch IVA definitions.

** In Game Usage

If you only at least these two mods installed, right clicking on supported command modules
will show the PAW UI with a group called "IVA Switch".

In the in-game editor it will show one or more coloured boxes representing each available
IVA, plus a "Select IVA" button that shows a drop down menu. When in-flight, only the
"Select IVA" button is available.

Without any other mods, it's likely you'll only see a "Stock" selection on stock command
modules, which is the vanilla IVA modules. These are always the default when adding a new
stock command module, or loading a vessel for the first time after installing the mod
(yes, it will revert any existing IVA mods to stock).

You can save the selection for the ship design in the editor, in which case each launch
will use that IVA selection.

For already in-flight vessels, you can change the selection while not in the IVA, and it
will be saved along with the ship, or when the ship goes on rails (switching away to
another vessel).

** Recommended and Optional Mods

The following table shows recommended mods and optional mods that can be installed to
provide non-stock IVAs for stock and other mods. Some of these provide additional IVA for
other mods, and some only provide a single IVA (in which case Reviva is merely providing
links and/or patches to ensure they work when installed).

This table hopefully links to all the known functional (ie. for command/flying) IVA mods
in existence that can work on KSP 1.12.x - if you know of more let the mod author know.

(*) You can have either RPM or MAS, or in fact both at the same time. MAS includes upgrade
scripts that render some existing RPM IVAs at a high quality and performance (in my experience).
